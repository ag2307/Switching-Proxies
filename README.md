# Switching-Proxies
### Switch proxies in ubuntu system quickly just by one key-press.

1. Make a file similar to the sample.txt replacing only your proxy settings in it. (Try to make the file in home directory so that u can   avoid the cd commands while changing directories in terminal for further steps.)

2. Remember if your proxy credentials contains symbols in it like `!,@,#` , etc. then type `\` before it. (escape character)

3. If proxy doesn't require **username** and **password**, then remove `username:password\@` part.

4. Then open terminal `Ctrl + Alt + T` and go to the directry which contains the .txt file by cd commands.

5. Type `chmod +x filename.extension` (makes the file executable).
 
You are done !!

Now to change the internal proxy anytime just go to the directory containing the .txt file and open it by `./filename.extension` .Type 
your system password and then proxy is changed.
